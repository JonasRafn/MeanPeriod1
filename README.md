# Java and Javascript Differences
Java is a strongly typed language, and Javascript is not a strongly typed language. This means 
that in Java when declaring a variable or function you must assign a datatype, this is not necessary
in Javascript, as the interpreter figures out itself what datatype a variable is. Java is also 
a high level programming language, and Javascript is a scripting language. This means that Java
needs to be compiled before it can be run on a machine, where as Javascript gets executed as 
the interpreter runs the program without any prior compiling.
