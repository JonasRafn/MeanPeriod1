What is node.js?

Node.js is a command line tool that provides a JS API to access networking and file system.
It runs on the V8 JS engine developed by Google and used Chrome. It is one of the fastest interpreters,
for a dynamic language on the market right now, and developers keep pushing for more speed.
In Node.js everything runs in parallel except for your code, and Node.js heavily relies on callbacks,
as part of most basic network or filesystem functions.
Example:
var fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('treasure-chamber-report.txt', function(report) {
  Console.log("oh, look at all my money: "+report);
});

fs.writeFile('letter-to-princess.txt', '...', function() {
  Console.log("can't wait to hear back from her!");
});
First the code reads a file and the it writes a file, these two task runs in parallel, and when Node.js finishes
the task it fires the callback function, but only one callback function can run at a time.

What is NPM?

NPM stand for "Node Package Manager", and is simply a manager for libraries in JS, there are two types of libraries
in NPM, "Package", and "Module". A module is loaded using Node.js require(), and is simply another JS file, with
functions that are reusable in multiple programs.
It is widely used, it is even used in the example above, "fs" is and external library used for accessing the filesystem.
readFile() reads a file from the file system and outputs it in the callback function to further use.
writeFile() writes a file to the file system and fires the callback function when done.
